During this project, I learned a lot of things about the web development, especially javaScript. I am mentioning some of the things I learned here:

..::befor and :: after allow inserting decorative content around elements for styling purposes without modifying the DOM. They are pseudo-elements, meaning they are treated like elements in CSS but are not actual elements. The content property is required, even if blank, to make the pseudo-elements render.

..declaring css variable and using them using --hue syntax.

..How we can create a class in one file and call it in another file to use there
..How to use the constructor function

..How new keyword works in javaScript - Each call to new MyClass() will create a new distinct instance The instances will all have the properties and methods defined on MyClass.prototype, but their own distinct copies of any properties set in the constructor.
